# RV Service Flow (RVS) — Auth0 Identity & Authorization

**As-of-Thread (ASOT) — March 10, 2026**

This document covers Auth0 configuration, RBAC roles and permissions, JWT design, ClaimsService, authorization policies, and the tenant provisioning flow. For domain model, data layer, and API surface, see the companion document **RVS_Core_Architecture.md**.

---

## 1. Auth0 Tenant & Organization Model

### 1.1 Architecture Overview

RVS uses Auth0 as the identity provider for all dealer staff. Customers are **never** Auth0 users in MVP — they interact via `[AllowAnonymous]` endpoints with shadow profiles and magic-link tokens.

| Auth0 Concept | RVS Equivalent | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Auth0 Tenant | Single RVS Auth0 application instance | `rvserviceflow.auth0.com` |
| Auth0 Organization | One corporation / dealer group (`Dealership`) | `org_blue_compass_rv` |
| Auth0 API | `RVS.API` audience | `https://api.rvserviceflow.com` |
| Custom claim namespace | All custom JWT claims | `https://rvserviceflow.com/` |

### 1.2 What Is an Auth0 Organization?

An Auth0 Organization is a first-class feature designed for multi-tenant SaaS. It represents one of your business customers — in RVS's case, **one dealer corporation** (not one physical location). Each Organization provides:

- **Scoped membership** — a user belongs to an Organization explicitly. Users in Org A are invisible to Org B.
- **Scoped roles** — Jane can be `dealer:manager` at Blue Compass but `dealer:readonly` at General RV. The role is per-Organization, not global.
- **Invitation flows** — a dealership owner invites their own staff. The invite is scoped to that Organization.
- **Per-org Identity Providers** — Blue Compass can use Google SSO while General RV uses Azure AD.
- **Branded login** — each dealership gets their own login page (logo, colors).

Each Organization's `org_id` becomes the `tenantId` used throughout RVS — the Cosmos DB partition key, the blob storage path prefix, and the data isolation boundary.

### 1.3 Organization ↔ RVS Mapping

```
Auth0 Tenant: rvserviceflow.auth0.com
│
├── Organization: "Blue Compass RV"        (org_id = org_blue_compass_rv)
│   ├── User: jane@bluecompassrv.com       → dealer:corporate-admin
│   ├── User: mike@bluecompassrv.com       → dealer:regional-manager (west)
│   ├── User: tech1@bluecompassrv.com      → dealer:technician (SLC only)
│   └── ... 100+ staff across 100+ locations
│
├── Organization: "General RV"             (org_id = org_general_rv)
│   ├── User: bob@generalrv.com            → dealer:owner
│   └── User: sara@generalrv.com           → dealer:advisor
│
├── Organization: "Happy Trails RV"        (org_id = org_happy_trails_rv)
│   └── User: owner@happytrailsrv.com      → dealer:owner
│
└── No Organization context:
    └── User: admin@rvserviceflow.com       → platform:admin
```

### 1.4 MVP Hybrid Auth Strategy

Auth0 Organizations are available on the Free plan but capped at **5 Organizations**. To avoid this limit during development:

| Phase | Auth0 Strategy | Cost | Org Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP / Dev** | Store `tenantId` in Auth0 `app_metadata`, inject via Login Action | $0 (Free plan) | Unlimited tenants |
| **Commercialization** | Migrate to Auth0 Organizations | ~$150/mo+ (Essentials B2B) | 50+ orgs |
| **Scale** | Auth0 Professional or Enterprise | Scales with usage | Higher / unlimited |

**Key point:** The RVS backend code does not change between these phases. `ClaimsService.GetTenantIdOrThrow()` reads the same `https://rvserviceflow.com/tenantId` claim regardless of whether it was injected from `app_metadata` or from an Auth0 Organization. The difference is purely Auth0-side configuration.

---

## 2. Auth0 API (Resource Server)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Identifier (Audience) | `https://api.rvserviceflow.com` |
| Signing Algorithm | RS256 |
| Token Expiration | 3600s (1 hour) |
| RBAC | Enabled |
| Add Permissions in Access Token | Enabled |

---

## 3. Actors and Auth Methods

| Actor | Auth Method | Profile Model | Status Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer (intake form)** | `[AllowAnonymous]` + rate limiting | Shadow `CustomerProfile` auto-created | None at submission time |
| **Customer (status page)** | `[AllowAnonymous]` + magic-link token | Existing `CustomerIdentity` | `GET /api/status/{token}` — cross-dealer |
| **Customer (future Phase 2+)** | Auth0 OIDC (optional upgrade) | `CustomerIdentity.Auth0UserId` linked | Full account access |
| **Dealer staff** | Auth0 JWT Bearer (Organization-scoped) | Auth0 user + tenant/role/location claims | Full dashboard access |
| **System / API-to-API (future)** | Auth0 M2M Client Credentials | N/A | DMS integration |

---

## 4. Roles

Roles are **scoped to an Auth0 Organization** (a user at Corporation A may be an admin, but have no access to Corporation B). One global role exists for platform operations.

| Role | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `platform:admin` | Global (cross-org) | RVS platform operators. Can manage all tenants, access gates, and global lookups. Not scoped to any Organization. |
| `dealer:corporate-admin` | Organization-wide | Multi-location corporate HQ staff. Full access to all locations, all data, user management. |
| `dealer:owner` | Organization-wide | Dealership owner/GM. Full control of their corporation's config, users, analytics, and all service requests. Equivalent to `corporate-admin` for single-location dealers. |
| `dealer:regional-manager` | Organization + region tag | Sees locations matching their `regionTag` claim. Cross-location visibility within a geographic region. |
| `dealer:manager` | Location-scoped | Service department manager at one specific location. Manages SRs, views analytics, manages location settings. |
| `dealer:advisor` | Location-scoped | Service advisor / front-desk at one specific location. Creates, updates, searches SRs. Primary daily user. |
| `dealer:technician` | Location-scoped | Technician at one specific location. Views assigned SRs, updates Section 10A fields (repair action, parts, labor) only. |
| `dealer:readonly` | Location-scoped | Read-only observer (e.g., accounting, external auditor). Can view SRs and analytics but cannot modify anything. |

---

## 5. Permissions

## 6. Role → Permission Matrix

| Permission | `platform:admin` | `dealer:corporate-admin` | `dealer:owner` | `dealer:regional-manager` | `dealer:manager` | `dealer:advisor` | `dealer:technician` | `dealer:readonly` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `service-requests:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ |
| `service-requests:search` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ² | ✅ |
| `service-requests:create` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| `service-requests:update` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| `service-requests:update-service-event` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ | — |
| `service-requests:delete` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `attachments:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `attachments:upload` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `attachments:delete` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `dealerships:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `dealerships:update` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `locations:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `locations:create` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `locations:update` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| `analytics:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | ✅ |
| `tenants:config:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `tenants:config:create` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `tenants:config:update` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `lookups:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `platform:tenants:manage` | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `platform:lookups:manage` | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

¹ Technicians have `service-requests:read` but the application layer further restricts to their assigned SRs only (checked in `ServiceRequestService`, not at the Auth0 level).

² Technicians have `service-requests:search` but the application layer restricts search results to SRs where `AssignedTechnicianId` matches the technician's `userId` claim. This enables the "My Jobs" queue on the technician mobile app.

---

## 7. Auth0 Login Action — Enrich Access Token

A Post-Login Action runs after every authentication and injects tenant context, roles, location scoping, and user ID into the JWT. This eliminates any need for the API to call Auth0 at request time.

**What the action does:**

| Step | Source | Claim Set | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `event.organization.id` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/tenantId` | Corporation partition key |
| 2 | `event.organization.name` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/orgName` | Corporation display name |
| 3 | `event.authorization.roles` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/roles` | Array of role strings |
| 4 | `event.user.user_id` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/userId` | Auth0 user ID |
| 5 | `event.user.app_metadata.locationIds` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/locationIds` | Array of location IDs (if present) |
| 6 | `event.user.app_metadata.regionTag` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/regionTag` | Regional scope string (if present) |

**MVP fallback (before Auth0 Organizations):** Step 1 reads `event.user.app_metadata.tenantId` instead of `event.organization.id`. All other steps are identical. The API-side code does not change.

**Location scoping:** Location IDs are stored in `app_metadata` (not in Auth0 roles) because Auth0 roles are permission bundles, not data scopes. A `dealer:advisor` at Blue Compass SLC has `locationIds: ["loc_slc"]` in their `app_metadata`. A `dealer:corporate-admin` has no `locationIds` (which means "all locations").

}
```

### 8.2 Sample: Single-Location Advisor

    "lookups:read"
  ],
  "iat": 1741561200,
  "exp": 1741564800
}
```

### 8.3 Sample: Platform Admin (No Organization)

```json
{
  "iss": "https://rvserviceflow.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|platform001",
  "aud": "https://api.rvserviceflow.com",
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/roles": ["platform:admin"],
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/userId": "auth0|platform001",
  "permissions": [
    "service-requests:read",
    "service-requests:search",
    "service-requests:create",
    "service-requests:update",
    "service-requests:update-service-event",
    "service-requests:delete",
    "attachments:read",
    "attachments:delete",
    "dealerships:read",
    "dealerships:update",
    "locations:read",
    "locations:create",
    "locations:update",
    "analytics:read",
    "tenants:config:read",
    "tenants:config:create",
    "tenants:config:update",
    "lookups:read",
    "platform:tenants:manage",
    "platform:lookups:manage"
  ],
  "iat": 1741561200,
  "exp": 1741564800
}
```

Note: No `org_id` or `tenantId` claim — platform admins operate cross-tenant.

### 8.4 Sample: Location Technician

```json
{
  "iss": "https://rvserviceflow.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|tech001",
  "aud": "https://api.rvserviceflow.com",
  "org_id": "org_blue_compass_rv",
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/tenantId": "org_blue_compass_rv",
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/orgName": "Blue Compass RV",
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/roles": ["dealer:technician"],
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/userId": "auth0|tech001",
  "https://rvserviceflow.com/locationIds": ["loc_blue_compass_slc"],
  "permissions": [
    "service-requests:read",
    "service-requests:search",
    "service-requests:update-service-event",
    "attachments:read",
    "attachments:upload",
    "dealerships:read",
    "locations:read",
    "lookups:read"
  ],
  "iat": 1741561200,
  "exp": 1741564800
}
```

Note: Technicians have `service-requests:search` (for "My Jobs" queue) and `attachments:upload` (for repair photo capture) but not `service-requests:update` (they can only update Section 10A fields via `service-requests:update-service-event`).

---

## 9. ClaimsService

`ClaimsService` is a `sealed` class registered as scoped. It reads the JWT claims injected by the Login Action and provides strongly-typed accessor methods used by controllers, services, and middleware. Follows the [MF ClaimsService pattern](https://github.com/markarnoldutah/MF/blob/8a37d47dd684403ea67176c3bb13c186c20c889d/MF.API/Services/ClaimsService.cs).

### 9.1 Claim Type Constants

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| `TenantIdClaimType` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/tenantId` |
| `RolesClaimType` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/roles` |
| `UserIdClaimType` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/userId` |
| `LocationIdsClaimType` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/locationIds` |
| `RegionTagClaimType` | `https://rvserviceflow.com/regionTag` |

### 9.2 Methods

**Tenant & User Identity:**

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GetTenantIdOrThrow()` | `string` | Reads `tenantId` claim. Throws `UnauthorizedAccessException` if missing. |
| `GetTenantIdOrNull()` | `string?` | Returns `tenantId` or null (for platform admins). |
| `GetUserIdOrThrow()` | `string` | Reads `userId` claim. Throws if missing. |

**Roles:**

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GetRoles()` | `List<string>` | All role strings from the `roles` claim array. |
| `IsInRole(string role)` | `bool` | Checks if the user has the specified role. |
| `IsPlatformAdmin()` | `bool` | Shortcut for `IsInRole("platform:admin")`. |
| `HasCorporateWideAccess()` | `bool` | Returns `true` if user is `platform:admin`, `dealer:corporate-admin`, or `dealer:owner`. These roles see all locations without restriction. |

**Location Scoping:**

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GetLocationIds()` | `List<string>` | Location IDs from the `locationIds` claim. Empty list if not present (corporate-wide users). |
| `GetRegionTag()` | `string?` | Region tag from the `regionTag` claim. Null if not present. |
| `HasAccessToLocation(string locationId)` | `bool` | Returns `true` if: (a) user has corporate-wide access, OR (b) `locationId` is in user's `locationIds` list. This is the primary location-scoping check used throughout the service layer. |

**Permissions:**

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HasPermission(string permission)` | `bool` | Checks the JWT `permissions` array for the specified permission string. |

### 9.3 How Location Scoping Works

Location scoping is **not** an Auth0-level concept — it's enforced in the RVS service layer using claims injected via `app_metadata`.

```
Corporate-admin (no locationIds claim)
  → HasCorporateWideAccess() = true
  → HasAccessToLocation("any_location") = true
  → Queries: WHERE tenantId = @t  (no location filter)

Regional manager (locationIds = ["loc_slc", "loc_denver", "loc_boise"])
  → HasCorporateWideAccess() = false
  → HasAccessToLocation("loc_slc") = true
  → HasAccessToLocation("loc_tampa") = false
  → Queries: WHERE tenantId = @t AND locationId IN (@loc_slc, @loc_denver, @loc_boise)

Location advisor (locationIds = ["loc_slc"])
  → HasCorporateWideAccess() = false
  → HasAccessToLocation("loc_slc") = true
  → HasAccessToLocation("loc_denver") = false
  → Queries: WHERE tenantId = @t AND locationId = @loc_slc
```

## 10. ASP.NET Authorization Policies

Authorization policies are registered in `Program.cs` using `AddAuthorizationBuilder()`. Each policy checks for the corresponding permission string in the JWT `permissions` claim.

### 10.1 Policy Definitions

| Policy Name | Required Permission |
|---|---|
| `CanReadServiceRequests` | `service-requests:read` |
| `CanSearchServiceRequests` | `service-requests:search` |
| `CanCreateServiceRequests` | `service-requests:create` |
| `CanUpdateServiceRequests` | `service-requests:update` |
| `CanUpdateServiceEvent` | `service-requests:update-service-event` |
| `CanDeleteServiceRequests` | `service-requests:delete` |
| `CanReadAttachments` | `attachments:read` |
| `CanUploadAttachments` | `attachments:upload` |
| `CanDeleteAttachments` | `attachments:delete` |
| `CanReadDealerships` | `dealerships:read` |
| `CanUpdateDealerships` | `dealerships:update` |
| `CanReadLocations` | `locations:read` |
| `CanCreateLocations` | `locations:create` |
| `CanUpdateLocations` | `locations:update` |
| `CanReadAnalytics` | `analytics:read` |
| `CanManageTenantConfig` | `tenants:config:read` OR `tenants:config:create` OR `tenants:config:update` |
| `CanReadLookups` | `lookups:read` |
| `PlatformAdmin` | `platform:tenants:manage` |

### 10.2 How Policies Are Applied

Policies are applied at the controller action level using `[Authorize(Policy = "PolicyName")]`. Example from `ServiceRequestsController`:

- `GET {id}` → `[Authorize(Policy = "CanReadServiceRequests")]`
- `POST search` → `[Authorize(Policy = "CanSearchServiceRequests")]`
- `PUT {id}` → `[Authorize(Policy = "CanUpdateServiceRequests")]`
- `DELETE {id}` → `[Authorize(Policy = "CanDeleteServiceRequests")]`

### 10.3 Two-Layer Authorization

Authorization in RVS is two-layered:

| Layer | Mechanism | What It Checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1: Permission** | ASP.NET `[Authorize(Policy)]` | Does the JWT contain the required permission? (e.g., `service-requests:read`) |
| **Layer 2: Data scope** | `ClaimsService` in service layer | Does this user have access to this specific location's data? (e.g., `HasAccessToLocation(sr.LocationId)`) |

Layer 1 runs in the ASP.NET authorization middleware (before the controller action). Layer 2 runs in the service layer (inside the action). Both must pass for the request to succeed.

Example: A `dealer:advisor` at location SLC requests a service request from location Denver.
- Layer 1: ✅ — advisor has `service-requests:read` permission.
- Layer 2: ❌ — `HasAccessToLocation("loc_denver")` returns `false` because advisor's `locationIds` only contains `["loc_slc"]`.
- Result: 403 Forbidden.

## 11. Auth0 Program.cs Configuration

### 11.1 Authentication Setup

The API is configured as an Auth0 JWT Bearer resource server:

- **Authority:** `https://rvserviceflow.auth0.com/`
- **Audience:** `https://api.rvserviceflow.com`
- **TokenValidationParameters:** Validate issuer, audience, lifetime, and signing key. `NameClaimType` set to `sub`. `RoleClaimType` set to `https://rvserviceflow.com/roles`.

### 11.2 Authorization Policy Registration

All policies from Section 10.1 are registered using `AddAuthorizationBuilder()` with `RequireClaim("permissions", "permission-string")` for each.

### 11.3 Pipeline Position

Authentication and authorization middleware run at position 6 in the pipeline (see **RVS_Core_Architecture.md** Section 9):

```
1. Dev-only endpoints (OpenAPI, Swagger)
2. HTTPS redirection (production only)
3. CORS
4. Rate limiting
5. ExceptionHandlingMiddleware
6. UseAuthentication() + UseAuthorization()    ← Auth0 JWT validation + policy checks
7. TenantAccessGateMiddleware                  ← Checks tenant is active
8. MapControllers()
```

## 12. Tenant Provisioning Flow (New Dealership Onboarding)

When a new dealership signs up for RVS:

```
Step 1: Create Auth0 Organization
        ─────────────────────────
        POST /api/v2/organizations
        {
          "name": "blue-compass-rv",
          "display_name": "Blue Compass RV"
        }
        → Returns: org_id = "org_blue_compass_rv"

             │
             ▼

Step 2: Store in Cosmos
        ────────────────
        Create Dealership document:
          tenantId = "org_blue_compass_rv"
          corporateName = "Blue Compass RV"
          slug = "blue-compass-rv"
          isMultiLocation = true

        Create TenantConfig document:
          tenantId = "org_blue_compass_rv"
          accessGate = { isActive: true, ... }

        Create initial Location document(s):
          tenantId = "org_blue_compass_rv"
          slug = "blue-compass-salt-lake"
          displayName = "Blue Compass RV - Salt Lake City"
          regionTag = "west"

             │
             ▼

Step 3: Invite Dealership Owner
        ────────────────────────
        POST /api/v2/organizations/{org_id}/invitations
        {
          "inviter": { "name": "RVS Platform" },
          "invitee": { "email": "owner@bluecompassrv.com" },
          "roles": ["dealer:corporate-admin"]
        }

        Owner receives email → creates Auth0 account → lands in dashboard

             │
             ▼

Step 4: Owner Invites Staff
        ───────────────────
        Via dashboard UI (future) or Auth0 Dashboard:
        - Assign roles (dealer:manager, dealer:advisor, etc.)
        - Set app_metadata.locationIds per user
        - Set app_metadata.regionTag for regional managers

             │
             ▼

Step 5: Ready

### 12.1 MVP Provisioning (Without Auth0 Organizations)

During MVP, Steps 1 and 3 are simplified:

1. **Create Auth0 user** for the owner with `app_metadata.tenantId = "org_blue_compass_rv"`.
2. **Assign role** `dealer:owner` directly (not via Organization).
3. **Set `app_metadata.locationIds`** if needed.

The Cosmos documents (Step 2) are identical. The API behavior is identical. The only difference is the Auth0-side setup.

## 13. Future: Customer Authentication (Phase 2+)

In MVP, customers are anonymous. In Phase 2+, customers who want persistent account access can:

1. **Opt-in to create an Auth0 account** from the status page.
2. Auth0 creates a user. The `CustomerIdentity.Auth0UserId` field is populated.
3. A `customer` role is assigned (no Organization membership — customers are cross-dealer).
4. The customer can now log in to see their status page without a magic link, access history, manage vehicles, etc.

Customer authentication does **not** use Auth0 Organizations (a customer is not "in" any dealership). The customer's `CustomerIdentity` links to their tenant-scoped `CustomerProfile` records, which are what the dealer sees.

## 14. Security Summary

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Tenant isolation** | `tenantId` from JWT claim → Cosmos partition key. No cross-tenant data leakage possible at the data layer. |
| **Location isolation** | `ClaimsService.HasAccessToLocation()` enforced in service layer. Location-scoped users cannot see other locations' data even within the same tenant. |
| **Permission enforcement** | Two-layer: ASP.NET policy (permission check) + service layer (data scope check). |
| **Token security** | RS256 signed, 1-hour expiry, audience-validated. |
| **Claim injection** | All custom claims injected server-side by Auth0 Login Action. Client cannot forge claims. |
| **Platform admin scope** | `platform:admin` has no `tenantId` claim. API explicitly handles the cross-tenant case. |
| **Magic link tokens** | 32-byte cryptographic random, 30-day expiry, rotated on every submission, rate-limited. |
| **PII in JWTs** | No PII in access tokens. Only IDs, roles, and permissions. Email/name are in the ID token only (used client-side). |
| **Org migration safety** | MVP `app_metadata` approach and Organizations approach produce the same JWT claims. No API code changes needed. |
